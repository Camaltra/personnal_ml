<img src="./readme_img/pn_arch.png" width="600"/> 

## Overview

This repository contain my own implementation of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) `PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation`  
All the theoretical will be process through a blog (loading ...)
